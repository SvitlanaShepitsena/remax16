New website for our customers

Remax 1st class is pleased to announce the launch of our new website. Our goal was to simplify home buying/renting process by making it faster to search, filter and even virtually visit home location without
a need to leave search results form.

We provide our Agents with possibility to fine-tune and save home panorama-view, so our visitors can immediately get the best 'virtual journey' to their potential new home
with a cirtanty that they are observing the right home and they do not need to leave niether site nor search results list. To the best of our knowledge this is a unique experience we glad to provide for our North
Chicago land customers.

Our search and recommendations algorithms are based on geo-information features distance and drive-time, so users will be provided with homes located in nearby locations. For example, for the query
"single family homes  skokie" the user will also get recommendations with single family homes in Niles, Northbrook, Glenview as recommendations. We consider our map based user UI as the most informative form
of interaction, so we implemented home clustering to provide best user experience. However, we still keep more traditional list-based search result list for those users who prefer that type.

From our analytics data we discovered that about 50% of our users use mobile devices to view www.remax1stclass.com  so our new site is equipped with responsive web design- making it compatible with dekstops, tablets, and smart phones.
We look forward to working with you soon, please contact us with any questions or suggestion.
